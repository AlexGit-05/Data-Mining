## Optimizing Sales Performance with Machine Learning

This project applies advanced machine learning algorithms to optimize the performance of a sales site by analyzing customer behavior, resource usage, and 
operational efficiency. Leveraging key metrics such as app and website response times, customer engagement data, and yearly spending patterns, the solution 
improves hardware resource distribution and minimizes response times during peak and low-demand periods. The insights gained guide the design of optimized 
algorithms for enhanced user experience, efficient database management, and data-driven decision-making.
