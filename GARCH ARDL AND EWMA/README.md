## Financial Market Dynamics: Crisis Volatility and Co-Dependence

This project explores the co-dependence between global financial market segments and oil prices during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
comparing it to historic crises like the Dot-Com Bubble Burst (2000-2002) and the Global Financial Crisis (2008). Using econometric 
models such as GARCH, ARDL, and EWMA, the analysis captures volatility, long-term equilibrium, and short-term dynamics between stock 
indices and oil prices. The insights provide a robust understanding of market behavior during financial upheavals, offering valuable 
guidance for investors and policymakers.
